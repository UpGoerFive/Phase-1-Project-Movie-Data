***
Questions to consider:
* What are the business's pain points related to this project?
* How did you pick the data analysis question(s) that you did?

***

## Data

Describe the data being used for this project.
=======
*A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.*

## Business Problem

Microsoft does not know anything about creating movies, yet they want to create a new movie studio. 
We need to make sure that Microsoft is going to be profitiable from their movies as well as build a good brand reputation.


## Data

We are using movie datasets from 5 different sources:

* IMDB
* ROTTEN TOMATOES
* TheMovieDB
* Box Office Mojo
* The Numbers

With these datasets, we will search for insights in box office performence and user ratings compared to various factors like genre, personel, runtime, production budget and release time.

***
Questions to consider:
* Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?
* What do the data represent? Who is in the sample and what variables are included?
* What is the target variable?
* What are the properties of the variables you intend to use?
***

## Methods

<<<<<<< HEAD
Describe the process for analyzing or modeling the data. For Phase 1, this will be descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How did you prepare, analyze or model the data?
* Why is this approach appropriate given the data and the business problem?
***

## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
=======
We will use descriptive analysis to discover trends in the data. We will also look at correlation and distributions to visualize
our finings.
